# BMICalc

### What does it do?
In this project, I have implemented a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator. The BMI tells us if our weight is healthy to our height. If you have low body mass in relation to your height, it might entail illnesses, as well if you have too much body mass.
To calculate BMI, you can divide your weight to the square of your height! Or, you can do it easier and funnier with this app!

### About
- This is a Kotlin only project. I started to write it to improve my programming algorithm skills.
- This project is only readable in console/terminal. The scope of the project does not include a graphic interface.
- It was produced without intention to be released.

### How to open this project?
I recommend you to use the <b>IntelliJ Idea IDE</b>, but you can open it in VS Code as well.
1. Once you have one of these IDEs installed, you may go to the green <b>"<>code"</b> button on page top and download the zip file.
2. Unzip the file and then open the IDE. On IntelliJ, go to <b>"file" -> "open..."</b> (select here the unzipped directory).
3. When the project is open, go to the <b>"main.kt"</b> file, click on the <b>hammer icon</b> on top, then "run" the app in the <b>run icon</b>.
4. You must interact with this program in <b>terminal</b>.

## Project highlight
 - I will update it here when the program is finished!
