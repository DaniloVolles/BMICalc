## About
This is a Kotlin only project. I started to write it to improve my programming algorithm skills.
This project is only readable in console/terminal. The scope of the project does not include a graphic interface.
It was produced without intention to be released.

## How to open this project?
I recommend you to use the IntelliJ Idea IDE, but you can open it in VS Code as well.
1 - Once you have one of these IDEs installed, you may go to the green "<>code" button on page top and download the zip file.
2 - Unzip the file and then open the IDE. On IntelliJ, go to "file" -> "open..." (select here the unzipped directory).
3 - When the project is open, go to the "main.kt" file, click on the hammer icon on top, then "run" the app in the run icon.
4 - You must interact with this program in TERMINAL.

## Project highlight
 - I will update here when the program is finished!
